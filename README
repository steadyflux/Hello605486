Instructions
This should be a very simple assignment: set up your development environment.

Follow the instructions in my video at http://vimeo.com/27961743. Create a "hello, world" application, export it, and send it to me.

Note: Be sure to name your projects starting with your prefix - this can be lastname.firstname or your domain name, if you have one, reversed (for example, mine is com.javadude). Use this same prefix for the start of your android package name.

You can create the zip to upload as follows:

    Right-click your project(s) and choose Export...
    Under "General" choose "Archive File" and press Next
    Make sure the following options are checked:
        Save in zip format
        Compress the contents of the file
        Create directory structure for files
    Choose the zip file to create in the To Archive File box.
    The name of the zip file should be the same as your project name, followed by .zip
    Press Finish.

Submit your project by 6pm on the day it's due.
